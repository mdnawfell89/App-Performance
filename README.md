# App-Performance
A complete data analysis of a digital learning application of 2019 using Excel, Python, and Tableau
The data provided has Student IDs which we can extract the number of students the company has and the stability of that number in each month.
Group ID represents each class in the application
Student arrival time and exit time to the class will be necessary to evaluate the time each student spends in each class.
session start and session end will provide us with the length of each class. we can then evaluate the student time attended for each class.

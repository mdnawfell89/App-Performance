# Performance of a Digital Learning Application 
A complete data analysis of a digital learning application of 2019 using Excel, Python, and Tableau.
The data provided has the following columns: 1-Student ID that will give us the total number of students the company has for every month.
2- Group ID represents the classes in the application like (math,physics,biology...etc)
3- Student arrival time and exit time allows us to evaluate the time that student spends in each class.
4- Session start and session end will provide us with the length of those classes. From these columns we can find the time spent in each class.

Note: The following Python file contains exclusive work for the month of december. you can manipulate my code to clean and extract the data for the other months.
